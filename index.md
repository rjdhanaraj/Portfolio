# Hello, I'm Renee 👩🏽‍💻
Welcome to my User Page! I'm a student, a programmer, and a lifelong learner.  
I'm currently exploring **GitHub Pages** and writing in *Markdown*!

## Why computer Science
I chose computer science because I enjoy solving problems and learning how things work. I like that I can use technology to build cool things that help people.

During my internship, I was introduced to cloud tools and worked on organizing data for projects. That experience helped me realize how powerful cloud platforms are, and I found that I really enjoy working with data and keeping it structured.
